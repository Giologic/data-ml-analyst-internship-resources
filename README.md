### Week 1

#### Introduction
REST API or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface is an architectural style/ format for requesting
data from web services. The different types of calls are : GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE. Each one has a corresponding standard of command. To put this into the context of SQL / database concept known as CRUD, the equivalent of each command is as follows:

Create - POST
Read - GET
Update - PUT/PATCH
Delete - DELETE

REST API is used in most web services that require communication between the web client (frontend interfaces) and the backend servers. Examples would be Twitter using Twitter API, Facebook using Graph API and so much more. 

Instructions:
Try to learn as much as you can about REST APIs. I have provided resources on the week 1 folder to get you started on the different calls you can make to the REST API Endpoints. Check out the REST API Tutorial Series for a more detailed look into what its is all about.

P.S:  No need to learn Node JS and Mongo DB in the tutorial series. Just focus on how they use the concept of REST APIs to communicate between the server and the client. I will be teaching you how to parse the data retrieved from the API to pandas dataframe once you're done with this tutorial.
